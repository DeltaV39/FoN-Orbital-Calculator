# FoN-Orbital-Calculator
An inter-orbit transfer and rendezvous tool intended for the game Flight of Nova, written in Python.

# Installation

## Windows/Mac
If you do not have Python 3 on your system, install it from https://www.python.org/downloads.

## Linux
Python is included in almost all distributions, but not all of these have version 3. To check, type `python3` into the terminal, and if the command is not recognised, install it according to your distribution or from the above link.

If Python 3 comes with your distribution, chances are it doesn't include the extra modules. These will need to be installed, either with pip or with your distribution's package management tool. In this case the modules are `python3-numpy`, `python3-tk`, and `python3-matplotlib`.

After completing the OS-specific installation of Python, download and run `FoN-orbit-calc.py`.
